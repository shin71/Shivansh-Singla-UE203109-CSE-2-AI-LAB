# implementation points

<ul>
<li>The program is same for both alpha-beta pruning minimax and naive minimax</li>
<li>The program will take depth as input which we will enter as 100 which wiil be max and big enough to traverse the whole game tree here</li>
<li>the program will also take input of whether we want it to run <b>naive minimax</b> or <b>alpha-beta pruning minimax</b></li>
<li>input 1 as response to question <i>do you want alpha beta pruning</i></li>
<li>according to the response we will get the number of calls</li>
</ul>

## input move sequence - 6 8 9 2
## depth - 100

### naive minimax calls -> 109966

<pre>
</pre>

### alpha_beta_pruning minimax calls -> 20697
