## implementation points

<ul>
  <li>the program takes number of test cases</li>
  <li>the program also takes size of array,range of array elements,seed to give,number of epochs</li>
</ul>

## demonstration of different epochs and seed values

here epoch are 5 and seed is 90 and range is b/w 0  to 100
```
```
here epochs are 100 while everything else is the same
```
```
here epoch are 5 and seed is 80 and range is b/w 0  to 100
```
```
here epochs are 100 while everything else is the same
```
```
here epoch are 5 and seed is 90 and range is b/w 20  to 60
```
```
here epochs are 100 while everything else is the same
```
